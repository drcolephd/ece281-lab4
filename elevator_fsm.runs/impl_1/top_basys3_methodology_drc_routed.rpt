2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell clkdiv_inst2/f_count[30]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) clkdiv_inst/f_clk_reg/CLR, clkdiv_inst/f_count_reg[0]/CLR, clkdiv_inst/f_count_reg[10]/CLR, clkdiv_inst/f_count_reg[11]/CLR, clkdiv_inst/f_count_reg[12]/CLR, clkdiv_inst/f_count_reg[13]/CLR, clkdiv_inst/f_count_reg[14]/CLR, clkdiv_inst/f_count_reg[15]/CLR, clkdiv_inst/f_count_reg[16]/CLR, clkdiv_inst/f_count_reg[17]/CLR, clkdiv_inst/f_count_reg[18]/CLR, clkdiv_inst/f_count_reg[19]/CLR, clkdiv_inst/f_count_reg[1]/CLR, clkdiv_inst/f_count_reg[20]/CLR, clkdiv_inst/f_count_reg[21]/CLR (the first 15 of 64 listed).
